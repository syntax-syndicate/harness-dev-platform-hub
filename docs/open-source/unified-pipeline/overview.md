This folder will be used to store work in progess drafts, thoughts, and work for unified pipeline docs. 

# Notes

For now, keep it all in one page for pipeline syntax

I've used [Q] to signify a question or quality issue.

Should we shrink yaml examples down to just their individual component sections instead of giving an entire pipeline sample?
- Do full yaml examples instead of partials. 

We need to check all the examples to check if they are authentic.



# TODO:

Ensure that we make a global keyword section

Need to define a UI design direction. 

Move up `container`, `script`, maybe `shell`, and `env` up a level. 

StepQueue and StepTemplate still not defined. 

Add [*] to all steps

Separate out Variables and Contexts from the expressions doc. 

Is the parity matrix really necessary? Maybe separate it out. 

Add codebase to contexts (Ask rohan)

Are the supported functions a partial list, or do we support all CEL functions? (Ask Rohan)

What is the syntax of harness CEL functions going to be?
